<h1>Personal dbt project</h1>
<p>Here is my dbt project which I made by going through the documentation and learning how to use its technology.</p>
<h2>Here is a short summary of what i've learned during this project</h3>

<li><a href="https://github.com/gabrielbonin01/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Data%20science%20portfolio/Deep%20Learning%20projects/Lending%20Club%20accepted%20and%20rejected%20loan%20data/Lending%20Club%20accepted%20and%20rejected%20loan%20data.ipynb">Lending Club accepted and rejected loan data</a>: Working with LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle. We will be using a Deep Learning neural network. Our goal here will be to predict whether or not the borrower will pay back the loan or not. Therefore, in the future, for potential new customers, we are able to assess whether we are able to accept their loan application.</li>
