<h1>Personal dbt project</h1>
<p>Here is my dbt project which I made by going through the documentation and learning how to use its technology. Here is a short summary of what i've learned during this project</p>


<h3>Snowflake</h3>
<ul>
<li>I created a new repository on github as my working directory</li>

<li>I created a <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-warehouse.html">Data Warehouse</a> and a <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-warehouse.html">Database</a> in Snowflake .</li>

<li>I created an admin and dev user with several different <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-overview.html#roles">roles</a> and <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-overview.html#privileges">roles</a>privileges</li>

</ul>

<h3>DBT</h3>
<ul>


<ul>


<h3>Models and Tests</h3>

<li>I connected my <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/snowflake-profile">dbt project profile</a> to my with my snowflake Warehouse</li>

<li>I tested and materialized several types of models: <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/materializations">Table, View, Incremental, Ephemeral</a></li>

<li>I created and configured several <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/schema">schema</a> to better divide my models</li>

<li>I created <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-variables">variables</a> and used them in my models </li>

<li>I have used <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/tests">tests<a> in almost all my models and I also have set up <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/writing-custom-generic-tests">custom generic tests</a><li>



<h3>Deploying and sbt cloud</h3>


<li>I connected my <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/tests">github repository to dbt cloud</a></li>

<li>I connected my <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/connecting-your-database">Snowflake database with dbt cloud</a></li>

<li>I created a <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-dbt-ide">deployment environment</a></li>

<li>I connected my <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/tests">github repository to dbt cloud</a></li>

<li>I <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/running-dbt-in-production">scheduled jobs</a> to use dbt in production via dbt cloud</li>



<h3>Advanced DBT Topics</h3>


<li><a href="https://github.com/gabrielbonin01/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Data%20science%20portfolio/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks%20for%20Image%20Classification/Digit%20Recognizer%20with%20the%20MNIST%20dataset/Digit%20Recognizer%20with%20the%20MNIST%20dataset.ipynb">Digit Recognizer with the MNIST data</a>: For this project, we work with work with the MNIST DataSet obtained from Kaggle. Using a Deep Learning neural network, our goal here will be to predict the Digit on images.</li>
